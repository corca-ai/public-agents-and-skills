# Suggest Tidyings

Analyze recent commits to find small, safe code improvements.

**Key Principle**: Each suggestion must be a perfectly safe, independent, small change. No logic changes, easy to review.

## Workflow

### 1. Get Target Commits

Run the script to get recent non-tidying commits:

```bash
{SKILL_DIR}/scripts/tidy-target-commits.sh 5 [branch]
```

- If branch argument provided (e.g., `/suggest-tidyings develop`), pass it to the script
- If no argument, defaults to HEAD

### 2. Parallel Analysis with Sub-agents

For each commit hash, launch a **parallel sub-agent** using Task tool:

```
Task tool with subagent_type: general-purpose
```

Each sub-agent should:

1. Read `{SKILL_DIR}/references/tidying-guide.md` for techniques, constraints, and output format
2. Analyze commit diff: `git show {commit_hash}`
3. Check if changes still exist: `git diff {commit_hash}..HEAD -- {file}` (skip modified regions)
4. Return suggestions or "No tidying opportunities"

### 3. Aggregate Results

Collect all sub-agent results and present:

```markdown
# Tidying Analysis Results

## Commit: {hash} - {message}
- suggestion 1
- suggestion 2

## Commit: {hash} - {message}
- No tidying opportunities
```

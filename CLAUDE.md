## Before You Start

**IMPORTANT**: Before modifying ANY code, you MUST:
1. Read `README.md` — check if your changes affect documented content
2. For plugin work, also read:
   - [Modifying/Testing/Deploying Plugins](docs/modifying-plugin.md)
   - [Adding New Plugins](docs/adding-plugin.md)
   - [Skills Guide](docs/skills-guide.md) — skill structure, env var conventions, design principles

Do NOT proceed with code changes until completing the above steps.

After modifying code, update any affected documentation.
Do NOT consider the task complete without updating related docs.

## Language

Write all documentation in English, except for:
- `README.md`
- `AI_NATIVE_PRODUCT_TEAM.md`

## Before You Start

**IMPORTANT**: Before modifying ANY code, you MUST:
1. Read `README.md` — check if your changes affect documented content
2. For plugin work, also read:
   - [Modifying/Testing/Deploying Plugins](docs/modifying-plugin.md)
   - [Adding New Plugins](docs/adding-plugin.md)

Do NOT proceed with code changes until completing the above steps.

After modifying code, update any affected documentation.
Do NOT consider the task complete without updating related docs.
